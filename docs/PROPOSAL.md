# CPTR 142 Project III: Choose Your Own Adventure

## Problem Definition

The goal for this project is to create a game that tells a story depending on the user's input.
After an excerpt from the story is output for the user to read, it will provide two choices for the user to choose from.
This leads to the story forking at each choice, creating different endings for the story.
The team assumes that users who run the program will enter the correct inputs.

### Key Features

* User-input centered program
* Horror-themed story
* Fantasy-themed story
* Multiple differing endings for each story

### Assumptions

The user will input the correct input.

<!-- The users of the system are good actors. 
No security (authtentication and permissions) will be implemented for this project. -->
